AI Pnuemonia pipeline system 

Pneumonia Detection Using Machine Learning

Description

This project was developed as part of my AI unit at university, where I achieved a score of 85%. The objective is to build a machine learning model to detect pneumonia based on X-ray data. The project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques, model evaluation metrics, and data preprocessing methods.

The project is intended for university students interested in learning about AI, machine learning models, and healthcare-related applications.

Features

Data preprocessing and validation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Implementation of multiple machine learning models

Model evaluation using various performance metrics

Use of SMOTE to address class imbalance
